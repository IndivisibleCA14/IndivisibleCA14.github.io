<h2>What is Indivisible CA-14?</h2>
<p>We are citizens of the California 14th Congressional District who oppose President Trump's ill-conceived and poorly implemented agenda.</p>
<p>We come from a spectrum of political views and backgrounds, but are unified by our opposition to non-inclusive and undemocratic parts of this agenda ranging from the assaults on women and people of color to the attacks on our independent judiciary.</p>
<p>We will use inclusion, respect, fairness, and truth to push our representatives towards a better country and future.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>
