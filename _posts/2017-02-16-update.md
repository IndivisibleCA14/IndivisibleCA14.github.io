Even though we don't live in a district with representatives who support Trump, there are still some actions we can take to help those that do:

 - Join a [phone bank](https://demaction.us/events/32075403395/) to ask voters to call their Republican representatives about the Affordable Care Act
  - If you have sympathetic friends in states with Republican senators, you can prepare and set up a fax in their name using [FaxZero](http://faxzero.com). You need to know their name, address, email, and phone number. FaxZero will require them to confirm it via email, so you won't actually be sending anything - just setting it up so they can confirm it via email and send it in. 
 - If you are a patient and persistent person who enjoys persuading folks on the other side of the aisle, [Resistance Manual](https://www.resistancemanual.org/Resistance_Manual_Home) is a great place to pick up well-sourced facts about current issues to bring to any debate.
