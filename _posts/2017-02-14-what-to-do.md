*What to Do This Week:*
   -  *Consider volunteering for an important job* in our group: join the team that follows bills in Congress and keeps track of our MoCs' activities on Capitol Hill. You can use an app like Countable, subscribe to Google News alerts, follow our MoCs on Twitter, or find our own method. We really need folks to watch Harris, Feinstein, and Speier so we know what they are (and aren't) doing for us.

  -  *Work the phone (or keyboard)*. Pick an issue that motivates you and [call or email](https://indivisibleeb.org/2017/02/09/blog-post-so-you-called-your-moc-did-it-count/) Members of Congress:

   -  Indivisible Team has provided [call scripts](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources-2/2017/2/6/scripts?) on a few issues. You can also find well-researched call topics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDmqtuOdxYCu3_F6ExZJXeeGWQGRV7wIxIbIF84AHQ8/preview).

  -  Ask Kamala Harris to look into [ICE's immigration raids](www.indivisiblesf.org/2017-02-05-kamala-harris-script-immigration.html).

  -  Ask Dianne Feinstein to [get Steve Bannon out of the White House](www.indivisiblesf.org/2017-02-12-feinstein-bannon.html).

  -  Ask Jackie Speier to do [everything possible to protect the Affordable Care Act](www.indivisiblesf.org/2017-02-12-speier-aca.html).

  -  Call [202-225-5074](tel:202-225-5074) to tell Chaffetz's (Republican) committee on Government Oversight that you expect [action on Kellyanne Conway's ethics breach](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14561864/kellyanne-conway-ivanka-trump-nordstrom).
