A lobbyist calls your Member of Congress every day. So should you!

  1. Call Kamala Harris: She just co-sponsored Bernie Sanders' [bill to make college tuition-free](http://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/148467/bernie-sanders-free-college-senate-bill)! **Tell her we approve**, and ask her what bills she's planning to introduce next. 
  2. Call Dianne Feinstein: After weeks of pressure from folks who called her office, protested outside her events, and even held "empty chair" town halls without her, **she has finally promised to hold *two* town halls**! There will be one in Northern California and one in Southern California during the upcoming recess; stay tuned for dates. **Give her a call to thank her.** Or, email her instead. DiFi counts emails and calls equally. 
  3. Call Jackie Speier: Her office doesn't do a great job of publicizing her events, so **ask her what she's planning for recess**! It starts this weekend.
