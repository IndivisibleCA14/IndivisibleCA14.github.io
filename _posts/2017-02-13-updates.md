   -  We now have a google group for make it easier for us to communicate. The google group is for coordinating and debriefing actions, discussing strategy, and making decisions as a group on issues that can't wait until our next in-person meeting. *If you attended a meeting, you'll receive an email from Peggy inviting you to join the google group. *Future attendees will also have the opportunity to join. *Thank you to Peggy for setting it up!*

  -  We also have a Facebook group; it's private, so you will need to request to join. To find it, visit [our public page](https://www.facebook.com/IndivisibleCA14/) and click the link to the group pinned at the top. The Facebook page is for sharing articles, petitions, news stories, etc. Be aware that anyone can join, even those who have not attended a meeting, so please use the google group for anything sensitive.

  -  Our website is up and running: http://www.indivisibleca14.com. If you see something that should be added, updated, changed, or edited, please bring it up in the google group. Thanks to Roderick for setting up the page!  

  -  Our Twitter account is active: [@IndivisibleCA14](https://twitter.com/IndivisibleCA14). Thanks Brendan for running it! In addition to us, follow [Indivisible Team](https://twitter.com/IndivisibleTeam).

 New to social media? Here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DWNAGaqViV7I) about how to use Facebook groups and [an article](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/twitter-onboarding-tips-for-new-users/) that explains how Twitter works

 *Face time with our MOCs:*

   -  "Conversation with America:" Our Congresswoman, Rep. Jackie Speier, held a town hall on Saturday 2/11 which several of our members attended along with the 14th District sub-group from Indivisible SF. Read a summary [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14RKpabc1fkTJjHsFOVofRoMDuo4BXXdbw1DNw2-cM_o/edit?usp=3Dsharing). Thank you to Victor from SF Indivisible for the notes!

  -  *Neither Senator Feinstein nor Senator Harris have scheduled town halls for the upcoming recess period.* Indivisible East Bay sent a [letter to Sen. Feinstein imploring her to hold a town hall](https://indivisibleeb.org/2017/02/13/a-different-kind-of-call),  which had many co-signers. If you get through to one of Feinstein's offices ([phone numbers here](http://indivisibleca14.com/moc), San Diego office is usually easiest), ask her if she will respond to the letter and hold a town hall on 2/26 in Oakland.

  -  If you want to pay a visit to Senator Feinstein's SF office, you can head to One Post (above Montgomery Station) and politely tell the security guard: "no, I don't have an appointment, but I would like to please speak with a member of the Senator's staff"
