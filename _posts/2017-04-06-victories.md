We have some celebrations this week:

 1. [SB 54](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/04/politics/california-sanctuary-state-bill-sb-54) (make California a sanctuary state), [SB 6](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-legislative-package-to-protect-1491268486-htmlstory.html) (provides legal counsel to immigrants facing deportation), & SB 31 (bars California from taking part in any future Muslim registry) **all passed** the California State Senate. They now head to the State Assembly; [find out who your Assembly member is](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/).

 2. This past Sunday, folks from our group met with Congresswoman Jackie Speier, along with representatives from two other Indivisible groups (Indivisible SF and Indivisible Coastside). **We thanked her for her advocacy on healthcare, and we asked her to take a stronger stand on issues that matter to us, especially climate change, civil rights, and hate crimes.**

You all made this happen! **This meeting was the direct result of our members' efforts**: your emails and letters, your attendance at her town halls, and your calls to her office. We hope it will be the first of many such meetings!

Also this past weekend, our group had a table at Jackie Speier's "Take Back America" activist resource fair. Here are some photos!
