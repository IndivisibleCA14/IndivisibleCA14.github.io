Join us at [Tax March San Francisco](https://www.taxmarchsf.org/) this Saturday, April 15th!

Weâ€™ll join [movements across the country](http://taxmarch.org/local-marches/) and peacefully march to demand that Donald Trump release ten years of his most recent tax returns to ensure that he is not [compromised by conflicts of interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgkqwXHXYk)--either foreign or domestic--and that he complies with the safeguards set forth in the Constitution.
